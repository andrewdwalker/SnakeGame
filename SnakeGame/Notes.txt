Added features...
1. Keyboard controls for player 1 (up/down/left/right arrows)
2. Second player.  Keyboard controls for player 2( w/s/a/d). Second player yellow. Easily extendible to 3+ players
3. Added modes such as Not dying on walls, dying if you hit any part of yourself (not just tail), and not allowing reverse movement.
   Kept requirments as defaults (you can go backwards, die if you hit a wall, and go right through your own body, but not tail)

What I'd add if I had more time and what I wouldn't bother with
1. No time for Unit Tests. I did this fast. Other projects I'm sharing have unit tests.
2. No need (or time) for await/async.
3. Should really adding persist to file functionality.
